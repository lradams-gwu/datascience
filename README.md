# Datascience
A collection of data analysis and machine learning projects. Most of my projects will utilized the jupyter notebook for communicating my code.

## Hobfield
Project files for using a hobfield network to learn image memories. Useful for demonstrating how simple hopfield neural network can be used to recover corrupted image files. See, for example the [hobfield](https://github.com/lradams-gwu/datascience/blob/master/hobfield/hobfield.ipynb) Jupyter notebook.

## Image
Project files for completing image classification and image retrival tasks. Leverages Dato [Graphlab](https://dato.com/) Create to perform a classification task using logistic classifier and a retrieval task using k-neareast neighbor model. Two Jupyter notebooks are provided for [classification](https://github.com/lradams-gwu/datascience/blob/master/image/ImageClassification.ipynb) and [retrieval](https://github.com/lradams-gwu/datascience/blob/master/image/ImageRetrieval.ipynb).
